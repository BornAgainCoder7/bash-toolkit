Bash Toolkit

This is my personal CLI toolkit for Linux system administration, cybersecurity, and blue team workflows.

I use these commands and tools daily for:
- Log review and analysis
- Network troubleshooting
- Cron job monitoring
- Scanning and enumeration
- Git and version control

Structure

- [`/toolkit/toolkit.md`](https://www.github.com/bornagaincoder7/bash-toolkit): All my core CLI notes and examples
- Future: Screenshots, experiments, real-world logs, and cron setups

This toolkit is a live resource and evolves as I grow in technical fluency and proficiency.
